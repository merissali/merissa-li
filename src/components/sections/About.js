        <AboutText>
          Hi! My name is Merissa and I am currently a 4th year student studying
          a double major in Business & Computer Science at the University of
          British Columbia.

        <AboutText>
          Iâ€™ve always loved solving problems, even - or especially - when
          they're vague. My most recent internship (as part of RBC's Amplify
          Program) involved ideating and creating a product from a vague
          business challenge, which was a process I enjoyed thoroughly and one
          in which I learned a lot about the product development process.

        <AboutText>
          With my technical and business-oriented background, I have a strong
          ability to translate business needs into technical requirements,
          communicate technical terms in a simple manner, and proven ability
          collaborating cross-functionally with teams such as UX, Engineering,
          and Marketing.

          I am seeking to apply my technical expertise and creative energy in a
          Product Management Intern role. I would also love to chat - feel free
          to reach out!
